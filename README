Zeitgeist
by Bernd Kilga <frame@console.cc>

Nifty helper script to automatically download the latest Zeit.de PDF ePaper and Audio MP3 files from their premium server.
Recommended to run on Saturdays, once per week (they push out new releases on Friday).

A valid Die Zeit Premium subscription is required, fill in username/password below and pick a target directory.
